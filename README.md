# Quill Icons
Quill is a 120+ iconset for your next email project. These icons were originally supposed to be a re-design of the iconset for Tempo, the mindful email client for Mac. All icons are designed on a 32x32 base grid. You can find the corresponding icons over in [Figma's community tab[(https://www.figma.com/community/file/1034432054377533052/Quill-Iconset).

## How to use Quill in your project
Quill is offered as an npm-package. Simply add `tempo-quill-icons` through NPM and include the name of the icon you'd like to use into your app.
